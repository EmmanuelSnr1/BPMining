# Java Setup: 
Here are the commands to install each JAR file to your local Maven repository. Assuming you are already in the `lib` directory:

### Update Your POM File

After installing the JAR files locally, include them in your `pom.xml` as dependencies:


To cover all aspects of process mining, including event log reading, process discovery, conformance checking, performance analysis, and process enhancement, you'll need a comprehensive set of libraries. Below, I've identified the necessary packages from your list to include in your project. 

### Key Libraries for Process Mining

1. **Event Log Reading and Basic Utilities**:
   - `xesstandard-6.10.126` (for XES standard event log handling)
   - `xeslite-6.9.338` (for efficient XES log handling)
   - `basicutils-6.12.1` (for common utilities)

2. **Process Discovery**:
   - `inductiveminer-6.13.9` (for Inductive Miner)
   - `heuristicsminer-6.10.78` (for Heuristics Miner)
   - `alphaminer-6.9.78` (for Alpha Miner)
   - `directlyfollowsmodelminer-6.12.2` (for Directly Follows Model)
   - `fuzzy-6.9.66` (for Fuzzy Miner)

3. **Conformance Checking**:
   - `alignment-6.10.122` (for alignment-based conformance checking)
   - `pnetreplayer-6.11.191` (for Petri net replay)
   - `pnetalignmentanalysis-6.10.114` (for alignment analysis of Petri nets)

4. **Performance Analysis**:
   - `bpmn-6.9.96` (for BPMN mining and performance analysis)
   - `performance-6.9.59` (for performance analysis tools)
   - `performancespectrumintegration-6.10.55` (for performance spectrum integration)

5. **Process Enhancement**:
   - `modelrepair-6.11.69` (for repairing and enhancing process models)
   - `logenhancement-6.9.371` (for enhancing logs with additional information)

6. **Petri Nets and Related Tools**:
   - `petrinets-6.12.2` (for basic Petri net handling)
   - `pnanalysis-6.13.1` (for analyzing Petri nets)
   - `acceptingpetrinetminer-6.9.97` (for mining accepting Petri nets)
   - `tspetrinet-6.9.69` (for transition system Petri nets)

7. **Visualization and Interaction**:
   - `inductivevisualminer-6.13.1020` (for visualizing process discovery results)
   - `interactivevisualization-6.9.57` (for interactive process visualizations)

### Example POM Configuration

Here is an example `pom.xml` configuration including these dependencies. Make sure to install each JAR file locally using the `mvn install:install-file` command as you did before.
