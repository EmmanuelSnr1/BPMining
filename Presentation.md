Given that you'll pause during the middle of your presentation for a live demonstration of your application, servers, and code, I will structure the slides to flow seamlessly into the demonstration. This structure will ensure that the technical elements align with your narrative and give the assessors a clear understanding of the theory behind your system and its practical implementation.

### Revised 8-Slide Outline with Demonstration:

---

### **Slide 1: Title and Introduction**
- **Purpose**: Briefly introduce the project, including title, your name, and the focus of the presentation.
- **Key Points**:
  - Project title: *Integrating NLP with Process Mining for Enhanced Business Process Optimization*.
  - Objective: Summarize the project’s goal (e.g., "Developing a system that allows non-technical users to query business process data using natural language").
  - Include your name and any relevant details.

---

### **Slide 2: Problem Statement and Motivation**
- **Purpose**: Explain why this project is important.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Problem**: Non-technical stakeholders struggle to interpret complex process data.
  - **Motivation**: Existing process mining tools are not user-friendly for people without technical expertise. Combining NLP with process mining democratizes access to data insights.
  - Include real-world examples of how this impacts business processes.

---

### **Slide 3: Research & Background**
- **Purpose**: Highlight the theoretical foundation behind your project.
- **Key Points**:
  - **NLP Overview**: Explain the role of Natural Language Processing in querying data (brief mention of Stanford CoreNLP and how NLP makes querying user-friendly).
  - **Process Mining**: Discuss how process mining works (e.g., process discovery, bottleneck detection) and mention the tools used (PM4PY).
  - Reference a few external studies or examples to strengthen your points【18†source】【19†source】.

---

### **Slide 4: System Architecture**
- **Purpose**: Show how the system works.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Diagram**: Present a visual architecture of the system (showing the interaction between NLP module, process mining module, and data handling).
  - **Technologies**: Mention the core technologies (e.g., Flask for the web service, PM4PY for process mining, Vue.js for frontend).
  - Describe how microservices architecture enables scalability and flexibility.

---

### **Slide 5: Demonstration Setup and Key Features**
- **Purpose**: Set up the context before you start the live demonstration.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Key Features**: Describe the main features of your system that will be demonstrated, such as:
    - NLP querying in action.
    - Visual output of process mining insights (e.g., identifying bottlenecks).
  - **Demo Scope**: What you will show (queries, server operations, system workflow).
  - **Servers**: Briefly mention how the backend and servers interact (highlight Flask’s role in API management).

---

### **Mid-Presentation Live Demonstration**
- **Purpose**: Show the practical application of your project.
- **Key Points to Demonstrate**:
  - **Query Processing**: Input a natural language query and show how the system processes it using the NLP module.
  - **Process Mining Output**: Display process diagrams or data visualizations generated by the mining tool (PM4PY).
  - **Server Operations**: Show server communication logs or explain how servers handle requests and responses in real-time.
  - **Code Walkthrough**: Open your code editor and briefly highlight key sections (e.g., how queries are parsed and processed).
  - After the demo, summarize the core functionalities you’ve just demonstrated.

---

### **Slide 6: Challenges and Solutions**
- **Purpose**: Discuss technical challenges and how you overcame them.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Integration Challenges**: Mention issues such as the difficulty in integrating ProM and how switching to PM4PY helped solve this.
  - **NLP Issues**: Talk about challenges in processing complex queries and how you refined the parsing process using Stanford CoreNLP【17†source】.
  - **Scalability**: Explain how the microservices architecture resolves scalability challenges.

---

### **Slide 7: Evaluation and Results**
- **Purpose**: Showcase the results of your project and user feedback.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Usability Testing**: Mention any testing you conducted, such as usability testing, and share performance data (e.g., response time for queries, accuracy of the process models generated).
  - **Results**: Share key outcomes of the project (e.g., how well the system processed natural language queries, accuracy in process mining output).
  - **Improvements**: Point out any areas where you see room for improvement, such as handling more complex queries or speeding up the response times.

---

### **Slide 8: Conclusion and Future Work**
- **Purpose**: Summarize the project and hint at future improvements.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Summary**: Reiterate the importance of combining NLP and process mining for business process analysis.
  - **Future Work**:
    - Real-time data processing.
    - Enhancing NLP capabilities to handle more complex queries.
    - Machine learning integration for predictive analysis【19†source】【21†source】.
  - **Thank You**: End with a final slide thanking the audience and opening the floor for questions.
